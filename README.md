# Description
Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.
In this project I've been given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. They've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).


https://trook94.github.io/FeedReader-Testing-P4/.



1. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in `app.js` to make the provided test fail

2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined _and_ that the URL is not empty

3. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty

4. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`

5. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default

6. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?

7. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`

8. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container
  
9. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`
